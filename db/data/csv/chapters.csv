6,"Organic Solvents","Organic solvents are carbon-based. Common uses include degreasing/ cleaning agents, paints, varnishes, lacquers, adhesives, glues, and chemical synthesis in the production of polymers, plastics, textiles, printing inks, agricultural products, and pharmaceuticals. It is estimated that millions of workers are exposed to organic solvents at the workplace, but nearly every human being can be exposed as well because of their widespread use. Because so many organic solvents have been or are still in use, it is difficult to propose a classification taking into account their chemical diversity, as well as their use or toxic potential. The classification below will be used in this chapter of Immunotoxibase as it is thought to provide a straightforward access to most organic solvents. Organic solvents can be first divided into non substituted hydrocarbons which include saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g. pentane, hexane, octane or dodecane), saturated aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane or methylcyclohexane), non saturated aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. cyclohexene) and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene or styrene). A second group of organic solvents consists of halogenated hydrocarbons which include aliphatic chlorinated hydrocarbons that are either saturated (e.g. methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride) or non saturated (e.g. acetylene dichloride, trichloroethylene or perchlorethylene). Other halogenated hydrocarbons include aromatic chlorinated hydrocarbons (phenyl chloride, dichlorobenzene or benzyl chloride), and chlorofluorocarbons (formerly grouped under the general heading freons). A third group of organic solvents consists of oxygenated hydrocarbons including acetates (e.g. methyl-, ethyl-, or isopropyl-acetate), alcohols (either mono-alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, or glycols such as ethylene glycol or propylene glycol), ketones (e.g. acetone, methylethylketone or cyclohexanone) and ethers (either aliphatic ethers such as dimethyl ether or methyl-t-butyl ether, or glycol ethers such as 2-methoxy-ethanol or butyl-glycol, or cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, and 1,4-dioxan). Finally, a fourth group includes miscellaneous organic solvents, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, pyridine or carbon disulfide."
