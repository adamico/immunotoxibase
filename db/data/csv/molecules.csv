"m1","Amikacin","Amikacin has been shown to impair non-specific host defenses to a certain extent, but no related clinical consequences have been reported. Hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. anaphylaxis [1] and contact dermatitis [2] are extremely rare.",1,2007-04-23 15:27:39
"m2","Dibekacin","Dibekacin closely resembles tobramycin structurally and has an antibacterial spectrum similar to gentamicin. The administration of 10 mg/kg/day dibekacin ip for 5 days to C57Bl/6 mice induced a 41% decrease in anti-SRBC direct PFC response [3]. Allergic contact dermatitis following use of dibekacin eye drops has been reported [30].",1,2007-04-23 15:32:35
"m3","Bacitracin","Bacitracin, first discovered in 1943 and introduced in the clinic in the 1950s, is widely used as an OTC antibiotic for topical use, and in cosmetics. It is a very weak contact sensitizer in the guinea-pig [30]. Contact dermatitis in humans has long been considered to be rare [31][32][33], but may have been overlooked [34]. Due to its wider use, bacitracin is nowadays one of the leading contact sensitizing antimicrobials in human beings. Thus, in a study of 54 patients prospectively patch tested with a standard battery of allergens plus 52 additional allergens, 13 (24%) were found positive bacitracin [35]. In addition, anaphylaxis has been shown to occur following either topical application&nbsp;[37][38][39][40][41][42][43] or surgical irrigation [44][45][46][47][48][49]. As allergic reactions have been increasing over the last 10 years, a careful re-evaluation of the risk benefit of bacitracin whose therapeutic activity is often at best elusive, seems to be warranted [50][51].",1,2007-04-23 15:30:53
"m4","Dihydrostreptomycin","Dihydrostreptomycin is primarily used as a veterinary medicine. In vitro exposure of NMRI mouse macrophages to 0.3 µg/ml of dihydrostreptomycin for 90 min induced a 300% and 20% increase in E.coli uptake and intracellular killing, respectively [54]. One case of allergic contact dermatitis reported long ago [143]. ",1,2007-04-23 15:33:54
"m16","Arbekacin","Arbekacin is an aminoglycoside derivative with bactericidal activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Extremely few data are available regarding the immune-mediated adverse effects of arkebacin. Arbekacin was found to enhance phagocytosis of treated mice dose-dependently, to stimulate IL-1 release, and increase antibody response to SRBC [52].&nbsp; One case of contact dermatitis has been reported [53].",1,2007-04-23 15:29:25
"m24","Kanamycin","Kanamycin is a second-line antituberculosis drug, which has been shown to exert relatively limited impact on the immune system. Hypersensitivity reactions are extremely rare. Only contact dermatitis due to other aminosides and cross-reacting with kanamycin has seemingly been described [79].",1,2007-04-23 15:37:30
"m23","Gentamicin","Only marginally immunosuppressive effects have been described. LPS-induced release of TNF-&#945; and IL-10 from human monocytes as well as CD14 expression were not affected by a 24h-incubation with 0.14 mg/ml gentamicin, a concentration estimated to be ten times the clinical therapeutic blood level [113]. Immunoallergic adverse events have been rarely observed including exanthema [55], anaphylaxis [56][57], allergic contact dermatitis [58][59][60] and immune-mediated cytopenia [61]. Recently, gentamicin was reported to be a common cause of contact dermatitis associated with bone cement used for fixation of joint prostheses [62]. Although renal failure is most often due to gentamicin-direct nephrotoxicity, acute interstitial nephritis has been described [63].",1,2007-04-23 15:35:00
"m26","Isepamicin","Isepamicin-specific IgG antibodies were found in the sera of rabbits injected with isepamicin and complete’s Freund adjuvant. In contrast, no specific IgG or IgE antibodies were detected by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in the sera of guinea-pigs and mice injected with isepamicin and aluminum hydroxide. No systemic anaphylaxis was elicited in guinea-pigs immunized with isepamicin-protein conjugate and aluminum hydroxide when rechalenged with isepamicin alone [83]. The relevance of these findings to human subjects, however, is unclear. One case of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis possibly caused by isepamicin has been described [84]. ",1,2006-11-02 15:28:45
"m25","Neomycin","The only marked immunotoxic effect of neomycin is contact sensitization. A number of animal studies established the contact sensitizing potency of neomycin. Skin rash occurs in 6-8% of patients when neomycin is applied topically. Contact dermatitis has been commonly reported [85][86][87][88][89][90][91][92][93][94][95][96][97][98][99][100][101][102] and was recently found to be the most frequent cause of contact allergy caused by topical drugs [103]. In another recent retrospective study of 47,559 patients with suspected contact allergy patch tested with a standard battery of allergens, 2.5% had a positive reaction to neomycin sulfate. The prevalence in an unselected population was estimated to be approximately 1% [104]. Individuals sensitive to neomycin may develop cross-reactions when exposed to other aminosides [105].",1,2007-04-23 15:39:21
"m27","Framycetin","Framycetin is used topically especially for the treatment of otitis. Although only very rare reports have been published [110], allergic contact dermatitis to framycetin is relatively common as well as cross-reactivity with neomycin. For instance, among 179 patients with chronic inflammatory ear disease, 29 (16%) had a positive patch test for framycetin and 76% of those with a positive patch test for neomycin were also positive for framycetin [111]. Systemic anaphylaxis was observed in a 77-year-old woman following topical treatment of leg ulcers. She developed a severe flush and dizziness within 10 minutes after prick testing with framycetin [112].",1,2006-11-02 15:32:12
"m31","Paromomycin","Paromycin is commonly used in the chemotherapy of Leishmaniasis and other opportunistic parasitic infections either locally or orally. In the optimization test, 0.1% paromomycin induced sensitization in 75% of the tested guinea-pigs [77].",1,2007-04-23 15:52:13
"m32","Ribostamycin","In vitro exposure of human PMNL to 2-40 µg/ml of ribostamycin for 30 minutes induced a 5-41% decrease in the intracellular killing of Candida albicans by human PMNLs [29]. At least one case of anaphylaxis&nbsp;[116] and one case of erythroderma [117] have been described.",1,2006-11-03 14:21:25
"m30","Netilmicin","The known effects of netilmicin on the immune system are limited to marginally impairmed neutrophil functions of unlikely clinical relevance. LPS-induced release of TNF-&#945; and IL-10 from human monocytes as well as CD14 expression was not affected by a 24h-incubation with 0.175 mg/ml netilmicin, a concentration estimated to be ten times the clinical therapeutic blood level [113]. No immunogenicity was evidenced in the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model in rabbits and mice, and in the systemic anaphylaxis model in guinea-pigs [114]. Hypersensitivity reactions are extremely rare. One case of cutaneous vasculitis has been reported [115].",1,2007-04-23 15:51:41
"m33","Sisomicin","Sisomicin exerts only marginal effects on neutrophil functions. Contact dermatitis has been very rarely reported [118].",1,2007-04-23 15:43:16
"m34","Streptomycin","Stevens-Johnson syndrome [137], and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis [138]. DRESS is also a possible complication of streptomycin treatment [139][140]. The only case report of streptomycin-associated lupus syndrome [141] may in fact reflect a pathological condition close to DRESS. Allergic contact dermatitis has been observed in treated patients [142][143][144] as well as occupationally exposed health personnel [145][146][147][148][149]. At least, 4 cases of immunoallergic hemolytic anemia caused by the administration of streptomycin&nbsp;have been reported [150][151][152][153].\r\n&nbsp;",1,2008-03-04 10:42:05
"m35","Tobramycin","Data on the moderate impact of tobramycin on the immune system are limited to innate immunity. Forty two days after the intramedullar implantation of a stainless steel needle with an adherent slime-producing Staphylococcus aureus in the left tibia, mice were injected with 1.5 mg/kg/day of tobramycin intramuscularly for 21 days. IL-1&#945;, IL-6 and IL-10 levels in the tibial extract were not significantly different from those in controls [165]. Only rare clinical hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, namely urticaria [157], exfoliative dermatitis [158], fixed drug eruption&nbsp;[159] and allergic contact dermatitis [160][161][162]. Cross-reactivity with neomycin has been described&nbsp;[163]. Inhaled tobramycin does not seem to be associated with an increased incidence of immune-mediated adverse effects [164].",1,2007-04-23 15:52:59
"m37","Dichloroethylene","Dichloroethylene (dichloroethene or DCE) can refer to 3 isomeric forms, namely 1,1-dichloroethylene and cis- or trans-1,2 dichloroethylene. It can used as 1,1-dichloroethylene or a mixture of cis- or trans-1,2 dichloroethylene. \r\n1,1-dichloroethylene was shown to exert adjuvant effects on several specific immune responses, presumably via the induction of local inflammation. Exposure of Balb/c mice to 15 ppm 1,1-dichloroethylene by inhalation 6 hr/day induced a statistically significant increase in the IgM response to sheep erythrocytes measured by the PFC assay in the spleen and lung-associated lymph nodes and a 200% increase in the production of IFN&#947; [166]. Lower concentrations, i.e. 5 and 10 ppm produced no or marginal effects, respectively. Mice were exposed to 10 ppm 1,1-dichloroethylene by inhalation 6 hr/day for 4 consecutive days during sensitization to intradermal ovalbumin without adjuvant. As compared to control nonsensitized mice, there was a marked increase in the production of IL-4,IL-5,IL-13 and IFN-g by cells of lung-associated lymph nodes, whereas no major differences were seen when compared to control ovalbumin-sensitized mice. However, 1,1-dichloroethylene increased the specific IgE response in sensitized mice [167].",5,2006-11-24 16:10:26
"m38","Allyl chloride","Allyl chloride (or 3-chloropropylene) is almost exclusively used as a chemical intermediate for the production of epichlorhydrin. Exposure of mice to 1.1 ppm for 3 hours induced a significant increase in susceptibility to respiratory streptococcus infection reflected by reduced pulmonary bactericidal activity, whereas exposure to 1.4 ppm 3 hours per day for 5 days caused both a significant increase in mortality and a marked reduction in pulmonary bactericidal activity [169].",5,2006-11-24 15:53:05
"m39","Dichloroacetylene","Dichloroacetylene is not available commercially. It can be formed from the decomposition of trichloroethylene. No information is seemingly available on the immunotoxic potential of dichloroacetylene. &nbsp;",5,2006-11-24 16:11:16
"m40","Carboxyethyl-germanium sesquioxide","Carboxyethyl-germanium sesquioxide (also known as propagermanium or Ge-132) was shown to exert immunomodulatory properties in varied systems and animal models [172][173][174][175], but the results of clinical trials proved vastly disappointing.",8,2007-01-02 18:23:28
"m41","Dibutyl-germanium chloride","At the concentration of 64 µg/mL, which was shown to be noncytotoxic for lymphocytes, dibutyl-germanium caused a reduction of approximately 50% in the number of antiSRBC-plaque-forming cells in an in vitro system. Interestingly, dibutyl-tin chloride that differs from diethyl-germanium by only one tin atom, exerted similar immunosuppressive effects in the same system, but also proved to be far more cytotoxic for lymphocytes [176].",8,2007-01-02 18:32:18
"m42","Spirogermanium","Spirogermanium is a heterocyclic derivative with germanium substituted for one carbon atom. It has been shown to exert anticancer and immunomodulating properties of limited magnitude [177][178].",8,2007-01-02 18:29:17
"m43","Roxatidine","Extremely limited information is available on the immunotoxic potential&nbsp;of roxatidine. Rats treated with 6 mg/kg/d roxatidine intraperitoneally for 8 days had an approximately 50% increase in local graft-versus-host reaction compared to untreated controls [209].&nbsp;Isolated case reports of immune-mediated adverse effects have been published including lichenoid dermatitis [183], erythrodermia [184], and erythema multiforme [185].",9,2007-04-23 14:29:36
"m44","Nizatidine","The effects of nizatidine on the immune system have not been fully investigated. Nizatidine, 300 mg per day, only slightly reduced NK cell activity impairment after transcatheter arterial embolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [186]. Systemic acute allergic cutaneous reactions may occur and cross-reactivity with ranitidine has been described [187]. Isolated reports of anaphylaxis&nbsp;[188] and leukocytoclastic vasculitis have been published [189].",9,2007-04-24 15:22:12
"m45","Famotidine","No marked effects of famotidine on the immune system have so far been evidenced. No influence on neutrophil activation as measured by myeloperoxidase activity and IL-8 release in the gastric mucosa was noted in 10 patients treated with 20 mg famotidine daily for 4 weeks [190]. In vitro, famotidine had no effect on neutrophil phagocytosis and chemotaxis at concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 2 µg/ml. However, a statistically significant, but less than 10% decrease in the production of the reactive oxygen species O- and H2O2 was also reported [191]. In vitro, famotidine had no effect on IL-18 release by human monocytes and dendritic cells at the concentration of 1 or 100 µM [192], and did not alter the antigen-presenting capacity of dendritic cells from cancer patients and healthy donors [193]. Similarly, famotidine did not enhance lymphocyte proliferation response to phytohemagglutinin, or cytotoxic activity against K562 cells in patients with gastric cancer [194]. However, in another study, 1-10 ng/ml of famotidine in vitro significantly increased the cytotoxic activity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of cancer patients by 65-80% [195]. A single dose of 40 mg famotidine reduced NK cell activity impairment after transcatheter arterial embolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma only slightly [186].\r\nIsolated case reports of immune-mediated adverse effects include erythema with eosinophilia [196], acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis [197], erythema multiforme with cross-reactivity with cimetidine [198], toxic epidermal necrolysis [199], leukocytoclastic vasculitis [200], contact eczema [201], acute interstitial nephritis [202], thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [203], immune-allergic thrombocytopenia [204][205][206].

"m47","Metiamide","The development of metiamide, one of very first histamine H2 receptor antagonists to enter clinical trials, was halted following several case reports of severe agranulocytosis due to direct hematotoxicity. No effect on dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) contact sensitization was seen in guinea-pigs treated with 25-125 mg/kg every 6 hours for 8 days [211].",9,2007-04-23 14:27:52
"m48","Granisetron","Granisetron is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist used as an anti-emetic drug in oncological and surgical patients. Granisetron did not impair chemotaxis and&nbsp;phagocytosis as well as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production by human neutrophils in vivo at&nbsp;concentrations up to 100 times the normal therapeutical levels [214].&nbsp;&nbsp;One case of IgE-mediated allergic reaction to granisetron with subsequently safe use of ondansetron has been reported [212]. The apparent lack of cross-reactivity between granisetron and ondansetron was confirmed by another case report of isolated urticaria associated with ondansetron followed by the safe use of granisetron in the same patient [213].",10,2007-04-23 11:35:45
"m49","Azasetron","Azasetron is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist used as an anti-emetic drug in oncological and surgical patients.

"m52","Metoclopramide","Metoclopramide, a substituted benzamide derivative, is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist acting at both the peripheral and central levels that is widely used for its anti-emetic properties. The available information although limited available suggests metoclopramide has minimal immunomodulatory effects (see table) that are very unlikely to be of any clinical relevance. Despite its long and wide use in the clinic, metoclopramide has only very rarely been reported to cause immune-mediated adverse effects including non thrombocytopenic purpura [215][216], IgE-mediated anaphylactic reaction&nbsp;[217] and occupational asthma [218].

"m54","Boldenone","Boldenone (1,4-androstadiene-3-one-17&#946;-ol), a steroid compound with relatively low androgenic and marked anabolic activity, was initially created as a veterinary drug essentially for the treatment of horses. Nowadays, it is misused by bodybuilders or other sportsmen. Transient flu-like symptoms have been described following use of high doses, but no evidence has been provided to suggest these symptoms might be immune-mediated.",31,2007-05-03 14:01:38
"m55","Aprindine","Aprindine is a class Ib antiarrhythmic agent. &nbsp;Agranulocytosis is a common adverse effect of aprindine [230][231][232][233][234][235][236][237][238][239]. Early estimates proposed an incidence of 1 case in 1,000 treated patients [235]. Subsequently, the International Agranulocytosis and Aplastic Anemia Study found an incidence of approximately 2 cases per 1000 patients-year [240]. The mechanism is as yet unclear. An idiosyncratic reaction was suggested by the concentration-dependent inhibition of granulocyte-macrophage stem cell (CFU-C) and pluripotent stem cell (CFU-GEMM) growth observed in two patients with a history of aprindine-associated agranulocytosis [241]. An immune-mediated reaction is also possible based on the positive results of an IgM-dependent lymphocytotoxicity test in a third patient [235]. Hepatitis, another well-recognized adverse effect of aprindine, is not thought to be immune-mediated.",28,2007-05-03 16:14:45
"m56","Doxepin","Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant structurally similar to phenothiazines with potent H1 and H2 histamine receptor blocking activity. Seemingly, no study focused on the effects of doxepin on the immune system despite its binding to central and peripheral histamine receptors and anti-inflammatory activity. In addition to the treatment of depression, doxepin as 5% cream has been approved for the short-term treatment of moderate pruritus, but this is a known contact sensitizer [248]. Allergic contact dermatitis has indeed been described in patients treated with topical preparations of doxepin [249][250][251][252][253][254], and exceptionally following oral treatment [255]. However, oral treatment with doxepin in patients with a history of contact dermatitis to doxepin cream is contraindicated. In2003,26 cases of contact dermatitis caused by doxepin 5% cream and reported to the US FDA were analyzed [256]. In 65% of cases the duration of treatment exceeded the maximal recommended duration of 8 days. Eczema, urticaria, purpura and papulovesicular eruption were the commonest manifestations. Recovery was obtained in all cases after cessation of doxepin sometimes associated with corticosteroid administration either topically or systemically. One case of immune-allergic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure was reported in a 46-year-old patient treated with doxepin for the past 4 weeks [257].",33,2007-06-18 15:59:30

"m58","Amineptine","Amineptine is an atypical tricyclic antidepressant no longer in therapeutic use due to marked potential for self-abuse. One case of anaphylactic shock has been reported [258]. Hepatitis associated with amineptine therapy were probably not due to an immune-allergic mechanism.",34,2007-06-26 17:03:41
"m59","Captan","Captan belongs to the thiophtalimide class of fungicides and is mainly used to control diseases of fruits, vegetables and ornamental plants. In rats or mice, captan did not show marked immunosuppressive effects (see tabulated data). As other phtalimide derivatives, it can induce both skin irritation and contact sensitization. Captan is one of the commonest causes of contact dermatitis in farmers and gardeners [259][260][261][262][263][264].&nbsp;Urticaria has been reported at least once [265].",35,2007-07-09 17:17:10
"m60","Sodium benzoate","Owing to its bacteriostatic properties, sodium benzoate (E211) is used as a preservative in various foods and soft drinks. It can also be found in mouthwashes and toothpastes, and pharmaceutical formulations. Mild scavenging effects on hydroxyl radicals have been described in human monocytes, neutrophils and alveolar macrophages in vitro [268][269]. This may account for the reported inhibition of phagocytosis in vitro; in contrast NK cell activity was not affected (see tabulated data). Sodium benzoate has been incriminated as a cause of asthma or asthma exacerbation [270][271][272][273][274][275]. In vitro, sodium benzoate increased histamine release from leukocytes of patients with a history of ragweed allergy [276]. The causative role of sodium benzoate in rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, chronic urticaria and angioedema has also been advocated [277][278][279][280][281]. Finally, isolated case reports of anaphylactoid reaction [282], anaphylaxis [283], occupational airborne contact urticaria [284], perioral contact urticaria [285], leukocytoclastic vasculitis [286], fixed drug eruption [287]&nbsp;and pruritus [288]&nbsp;have been published.",36,2007-07-10 17:06:01
"m61","Clometacin","Despite its chemical structure closely related to that of indomethacin, clometacin was mainly used as an analgesic and had low anti-inflammatory potency. A large number of immune allergic complications have been described, which led to clometacin withdrawal from the market in 1987. Although thrombocytopenia [291][292][293], interstitial nephritis [294][295][296][297][298][299] and immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia&nbsp;[300] have been reported, hepatitis was the most frequent and severe adverse event associated with clometacin [293][295][296][297][301][302][303][304][305][306][307][308][309][310][311][312][313][314][315][316][317]. A lethal outcome was noted in up to 10% of cases. The accelerated relapse following inadvertent challenge, the presence of fever, urticaria or pruritus, eosinophilia and elevated gammaglobulin levels is in keeping with an immune-mediated, and possibly auto-immune mechanism [318]. Indeed, antinuclear or anti-smooth muscle antibodies were present in 60% of cases [319][320].",37,2007-07-11 14:43:30
"m62","Phenprocoumon","Phenprocoumon is a coumarinic oral anticoagulant used for the prophylactic treatment of thromboembolic disorders. Following the first report by Kreiter and Fink [349], hepatitis has been repeatedly described as a complication of phenprocoumon therapy [350][351][352][353][354][355][356][357][358][359][360][361][362][363][364][365][366][367]. Although an immune-mediated mechanism has never been conclusively demonstrated to be involved, the lack of dose dependency, the usually accelerated time course following rechallenge, the eosinophilic infiltrate noticed in the liver biopsy specimens from several patients, and possible cross-reactivity among coumarinic derivatives support this hypothesis. The role of phenprocoumon metabolites resulting in immune-allergic or auto-immune reaction has been advocated, but never substantiated. Direct hepatotoxicity may also be involved in rare cases.",40,2007-08-25 17:57:00
"m63","Aclacinomycin","Aclacinomycin is an anthracycline antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces galileus. Toxicity for the bone marrow was evidenced in standard toxicity studies&nbsp;[368] and confirmed in further clinical studies. Unexpectedly, aclacinomycin was shown to augment immune responses [369]. For instance, aclacinomycin significantly increased the anti-SRBC plaque forming cell (PFC)response and delayed-type hypersensitivity to oxazolone in mice given a single dose of 4-8 mg/kg intraperitoneally 2-4 days prior to immunization [370]. These and similar findings from the same laboratory were suggested to reflect the abrogation of “suppressor cell” activity by aclacinomycin [371][372][373]. The practical relevance of these findings, however, is unclear. Indeed, when 0.1 to 5 mg/kg aclacinomycin were given intravenously to mice with or after the antigen, there was a dose-dependent reduction in the anti-SRBC PFC response that reached statistical significance from 1 mg/kg upward. A similar, but less marked trend was noted in the production of anti-SRBC agglutinating antibody. In contrast, cellular immunity assessed with a popliteal lymph node assay was not affected [374]. In addition, repeated intravenous administrations of 1.5-2 mg/kg aclacinomycin exerted a protective effect against two graft-vs-host (GvH) murine diseases, i.e. glomerulonephritis and hemolytic anemia. Suppression of B lymphocyte function was suggested to be involved. Whereas aclacinomycin exerted no effect on IL-1 and IL-2 release by rat splenocytes in vitro [375], a single intraperitoneal injection of 4 mg/kg induced an increase in IL-1 release by mouse peritoneal macrophages [376]. Conflicting effects on murine NK cell activity were also obtained depending on the dose tested: a single 2-4 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection of aclacinomycin resulted in augmented activity, whereas reduced activity was noted following the injection of 8 mg/kg [377]. Finally, a single intraperitoneal injection of 4 mg/kg aclacinomycin was found to cause increased phagocytic activity of mouse peritoneal macrophages as measured by Candida ingestion, chemiluminescence and superoxide determination in response to stimulation with zymosan and phorbol myristate [378]. However, in vitro 10-100 µg/ml of aclacinomycin induced a dose-dependent reduction in human neutrophil phagocytosis assessed by superoxide production, NADPH oxidase activity, and ingestion of yeast particles and oil droplets [379]. Importantly, a concentration as low as 40 ng/ml, which can be achieved following the intravenous administration of 20 mg to human subjects was shown to inhibit phagocytosis. In vitro, aclacinomycin was shown to induce histamine release from rat mast cells [380].",24,2007-10-30 14:41:15

"m65","Tramadol","Tramadol is an atypical centrally acting analgesic with low affinity for the opioid µ receptors and monoamine reuptake blocking activities. In contrast to narcotic analgesics such as morphine, tramadol has limited effects on immune function. Although a significant decrease in concanavalin A- and phytohemagglutinin-induced T lymphocyte proliferation was observed after a single subcutaneous injection of 20 or 30 mg/kg in rats with chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve, no effects were noted on NK cell activity [381]. A decrease in lymphoproliferation was also noted after a 7-day subcutaneous continuous infusion of80,but not 40 mg/kg/d of tramadol, but again NK cell activity was not affected. In mice, NK cell activity was significantly increased following a single subcutaneous injection of only 1 mg/kg, whereas IL-2 production was increased with a single dose of 10 mg/kg [382]. The inhibitory properties of tramadol on serotonin reuptake were suggested to account for these enhancing effects, especially the augmented NK cell activities, which markedly differ from those of morphine [383]. The lack of immunosuppressive and even the possibly immunoenhancing potential of tramadol was confirmed by several human studies. An early report mentioned no effects on immunoglobulin levels, cellular immunity and neutrophil phagocytosis in cancer patients after a 2-week treatment with tramadol [384]. Subsequently, a study of 30 surgical patients given either 100 mg tramadol or 10 mg morphine intramuscularly found a decreased PHA-induced lymphocyte proliferation due to surgical stress in all patients, which returned to baseline levels after 2 hours only in the tramadol-treated group [386]. In addition, NK cell activity was significantly increased by tramadol, but was not affected by surgical stress or morphine. When comparing surgical patients scheduled for conventional pulmonary lobectomy anesthetized with enflurane of whom 20 were given tramadol 1.5 mg/kg intravenously followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg/h until the end of surgery, and 20 intravenous saline, a statistically significant increase in serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels was seen after surgery, but there was no difference between both groups. In contrast, serum IL-2 levels were increased in the tramadol-treated patients, and remained low in the saline-treated patients [387]. The enhancing effect of tramadol on IL-2 production measured at 3 and 10 hours postoperatively was also reported in human subjects in contrast to morphine and fentanyl [388]. Finally, there was no evidence of impaired phagocytosis assessed from latex bead uptake following in vitro incubation of human neutrophils and monocytes for 60 minutes with 5-20 µg/ml tramadol [389].\r\nHypersensitivity reactions associated with tramadol administration have rarely been reported until recently. No histamine release was evidenced following the intravenous injection of 100 mg tramadol to 13 human healthy volunteers [390]. Only two cases of anaphylactic reactions have seemingly been reported [391]. Angioedema&nbsp;[392] and hypersensitivity pneumonitis&nbsp;[393] have been reported only once. Although one single report of severe toxic dermatitis has so far been published [394], tramadol may be emerging as a significant cause of severe cutaneous adverse reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: the multicenter EuroSCAR study recently found a relative risk of 20 (4.4-93) in tramadol-treated patients&nbsp;[395].",41,2008-02-05 08:47:35
"m66","Acrolein","Acrolein (acrylaldehyde or propenal) is a highly electrophilic unsaturated aldehyde primarily used nowadays in chemical synthesis, especially for acrylic polymers, and very rarely as a herbicide or slimicide, one of its former uses. This is a very strong pulmonary as well as skin irritant utilized as a chemical weapon during World War I. Major concern over acrolein toxicity subsequently focused on its role as a decomposition metabolite of the cytostatic agent cyclophosphamide originating in various adverse effects including cystitis. Acrolein is also formed during the combustion of organic materials, and is suspected to play a role in lung cancer due to tobacco smoking. Marked cytotoxicity in which lipid peroxidation via generation of oxygen radicals is considered to be an essential feature, is a hallmark of acrolein toxicity. Direct cytotoxicity to the lung tissue and cells, such as macrophages, is indeed a critical mechanism in acrolein-induced impairment of non specific resistance to microbial pathogens. Whether specific immune functions can also be altered by exposure to acrolein is somewhat controversial.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThere is conclusive evidence that acrolein exposure results in suppressed lung defenses [396]. Acrolein-induced non specific inflammation is by far the leading mechanism. Irritation of the respiratory airways following acute acrolein exposure involves activation of macrophages that release various cytokines including IL-8 and TNFa [397]. Acrolein is dose-dependently cytotoxic to alveolar macrophages as demonstrated by the induction of apoptosis and necrosis [398]. However, effects on human alveolar macrophages in vitro have been observed only at concentrations that alter cell viability [399]. The chemotactic response of human PMNL in vitro was found to be inhibited at concentrations above 100 µM&nbsp;[400] and this inhibition was suggested to be the consequence of a direct toxic effect of acrolein without any influence on PMNL adherence [401]. Phagocytosis of alveolar and peritoneal macrophages assessed by 51Cr-SRBC uptake and various enzyme activities was enhanced in Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to 0.1,1.0 or 3.0 ppm acrolein 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 3 weeks, but this was not associated with any change in the lung clearance 35S-labeled Klebsiella pneumoniae at any of the concentration tested [402]. This latter finding is in disagreement with the results of several studies in mice. Dose-dependent impairment of the lung clearance of 32P-labeled Staphylococcus aureus was found in Swiss mice exposed to 3 or 6 ppm acrolein for 8 hours, whereas higher concentrations did not induce more severe impairment [403]. In Swiss mice previously infected by the influenza A/PR8/34 virus, staphylococcal lung clearance was nearly abrogated following inhalation of 6 ppm acrolein for 8 hours. A single 3-hour inhalation of 0.1 ppm acrolein affected neither the pulmonary bactericidal activity of CD1 mice against 35S-labelled Klebsiella pneumoniae nor the mortality induced by an aerosol of Streptococcus zooepidermicus, whereas 5 daily inhalations significantly reduced bactericidal activity, but did not affect mortality [169]. Finally, mice exposed to 1-2 ppm acrolein had a significant inhibition of S.aureus and Proteus mirabilis intrapulmonary killing, which was further augmented in mice previously infected by the Sendai virus [405]. However, exposure of Swiss mice to 2.5 ppm acrolein for 4 hours/day for 4 days had no effect on the intrapulmonary killing of S.aureus, P.mirabilis, or Listeria monocytogenes, and pulmonary elimination of influenza A virus [406].\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAlthough an influence of acrolein on adaptive immunity has been suggested, there is limited evidence to support this view. The single intravenous administration of 100 µmol/kg acrolein to female mice 1 day before sheep red blood cells resulted in a 50% increase in the DTH response measured by footpad swelling. The anti-SRBC PFC response was increased by 88 and 60% after the administration of 30 and 100 µmol/kg acrolein 1 day before sensitization, and the in vitro PFC response was similarly augmented following acrolein exposure in the range of 3x10-7 to 3x10-6 M [407]. As the same results have been previously reported with cyclophosphamide, the conclusion was made that acrolein is the immunopharmacologically active metabolite of cyclophosphamide. In Sprague-Dawley rats, however, the inhalation of 0.1,1.0,or 3.0 ppm of acrolein 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 3 weeks had no effects on the anti-SRBC PFC response in lung-associated lymph nodes, the lymphocyte proliferation of splenocytes and lung-associated lymph node cells induced by PHA or Salmonella typhimurium, and the mortality induced by experimental L.monocytogenes infection [408]. The only significant findings were local histological changes of the respiratory epithelium. Acrolein did not induce any significant decrease in the anti-SRBC response of murine splenocytes exposed in vitro for 1 hour to 3 or 10 µM of acrolein, whereas a total abolition of the response was noticed with 100 µM, a concentration that severely altered cell viability. Similar findings were observed on the in vitro PWM-induced IgM response of human tonsilar lymphocytes, whereas there was a 30% decrease in PWM-induced proliferation at the concentration of 10 µM that did not affected cell viability [409]. Acrolein induced a concentration-dependent decrease in IL-1&#946; and IL-2 production by human peripheral blood lymphocytes and had a less marked effect on IL-8,GM-CSF, IL-6,IL-10,and IFN-&#947; production. The IC50 for IL-2,TNF-a and GM-CSF was below 2.5 µMol/L, a concentration that did not affect cell viability [410]. \r\n&nbsp;\r\nAcrolein failed to produce contact sensitization in guinea pigs [411].",42,2008-02-07 16:16:33
"m67","Dieldrin","Dieldrin is an organochlorine insecticide originally developed as an alternative to DDT. It is similarly characterized by an extremely long persistence. It was once largely used, but is now banned in most of the world. Relatively little information is available on the immunotoxic potential of dieldrin. Immunosuppressive effects have been found at somewhat high doses only with limited relevance to environmental exposure (see Table).\r\n&nbsp;\r\nA few human studies investigated the immunotoxic potential of dieldrin exposure. A study of 101 Japanese infants (mean age = approx. 10 months) with documented exposure to dioxins, PCBs and various organochlorine insecticides including dieldrin evidenced significance changes in lymphocyte subsets, but none in relation with dieldrin [412]. In Inuit infants during the first year of life, otitis media was the most common infection followed by pulmonary infections and a correlation was found between the relative risk of otitis media, but not pulmonary infections and the concentration of dieldrin in breast milk fat. Only minimal changes in immunologic parameters including lower white blood cell count with lower CD4+ T lymphocyte number at 3 months of age and reduced serum IgA levels at 7 and 12 months of age were evidenced, but no statistical correlation with dieldrin exposure was found [413]. Although the possible relation between pesticide exposure and the occurrence of lymphomas is still a controversial issue, no increase in mortality was found in a cohort of 343 workers with high and documented occupational exposure to dieldrin [414]. Similarly negative results have been published [415]. Studies in wildlife species generated somewhat conflicting results. Exposure of the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) to 2.1 ng/g body weight (total dose over the 10-week study) resulted in significant suppression of antibody production and delayed-type hypersensitivity [416]. Samples of lymphoid organs including axilary and inguinal lymph nodes, spleen and thymus from a total of 82 Greenland Sea polar bears (Ursus maritimus) were collected for histopathological examination. Contamination to various organochlorine derivatives including PCBs, hexachlorobenzene, DDT, HCH, chlordane and dieldrin was evidenced by analysis of adipose tissue (blubber samples). No significant histopathological anomalies were found in any of the tissues examined and only an increased count of secondary follicles in the spleen of uncertain relevance correlated with dieldrin exposure [417].\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNo hypersensitivity reactions induced by dieldrin have so far been reported except for one case of immunoallergic hemolytic anemia in a 52-year-old male [418]. Although he had no documented history of exposure to dieldrin and low dieldrin concentrations in plasma and adipose tissue, the diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of specific anti-dieldrin antibodies. An increased prevalence of antinuclear antibodies was found in a rural population exposed to various insecticides or mixtures of insecticides including dieldrin. However, no specific data on exposure were provided [419]. ",43,2008-02-14 17:39:43
