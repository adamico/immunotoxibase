"c6","Organic Solvents","Organic solvents are carbon-based. Common uses include degreasing/ cleaning agents, paints, varnishes, lacquers, adhesives, glues, and chemical synthesis in the production of polymers, plastics, textiles, printing inks, agricultural products, and pharmaceuticals. It is estimated that millions of workers are exposed to organic solvents at the workplace, but nearly every human being can be exposed as well because of their widespread use. Because so many organic solvents have been or are still in use, it is difficult to propose a classification taking into account their chemical diversity, as well as their use or toxic potential. The classification below will be used in this chapter of Immunotoxibase as it is thought to provide a straightforward access to most organic solvents. Organic solvents can be first divided into non substituted hydrocarbons which include saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g. pentane, hexane, octane or dodecane), saturated aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane or methylcyclohexane), non saturated aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. cyclohexene) and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene or styrene). A second group of organic solvents consists of halogenated hydrocarbons which include aliphatic chlorinated hydrocarbons that are either saturated (e.g. methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride) or non saturated (e.g. acetylene dichloride, trichloroethylene or perchlorethylene). Other halogenated hydrocarbons include aromatic chlorinated hydrocarbons (phenyl chloride, dichlorobenzene or benzyl chloride), and chlorofluorocarbons (formerly grouped under the general heading freons). A third group of organic solvents consists of oxygenated hydrocarbons including acetates (e.g. methyl-, ethyl-, or isopropyl-acetate), alcohols (either mono-alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, or glycols such as ethylene glycol or propylene glycol), ketones (e.g. acetone, methylethylketone or cyclohexanone) and ethers (either aliphatic ethers such as dimethyl ether or methyl-t-butyl ether, or glycol ethers such as 2-methoxy-ethanol or butyl-glycol, or cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, and 1,4-dioxan). Finally, a fourth group includes miscellaneous organic solvents, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, pyridine or carbon disulfide.",nil,nil

"f1","Aminosides","All aminosides (or aminoglycosides) share a common basic chemical structure, which can account for a certain degree of cross-reactivity, especially in the area of contact sensitization. Although markedly toxic for the kidney and the inner ear, aminosides remain useful in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic gram-negative bacteria. Immunodepression has been a matter of transient concern and a few derivatives were shown to impair specific and/or nonspecific immune mechanisms. No conclusive clinical consequences, however, have ever been demonstrated. Hypersensitivity reactions are rare, except contact dermatitis associated with some older derivatives, such as neomycin. Autoimmune reactions have seemingly never been suspected to occur.",1,2008-03-04 10:42:05
"f5","Aliphatic chlorinated hydrocarbons","\r\nAliphatic chlorinated hydrocarbons are very efficient organic solvents. Even though their uses have been markedly declining during the past decades either due to excessive toxicity or a negative impact on the ozone layer of the atmosphere, a number of derivatives are still in use today. They are divided into saturated and non saturated derivatives. Saturated derivatives include (methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, ethylene dichloride, methylchloroform, vinyl trichloride, 1,2-dichloropropane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloethane and perchlorethane). Non saturated derivatives include acetylene dichloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, dichloroacetylene, 1,3-dichloropropene and allyl chloride. Overall, there is limited information on their potential immunotoxicity.",6,2006-11-24 16:11:16
"f6","Thallium","The impact on the immune system of thallium, a highly toxic non-essential heavy metal, has seemingly not been studied either in animals or human beings. One case of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis has been reported following thallium-201 scintigraphy [170].",7,2006-12-24 17:32:31
"f7","Polonium","Polonium or polonium-210, first discovered by Pierre and Marie Curie, is a very rare element in Earth's crust because all of its isotopes are radioactive with a short half-life. It is found mainly in uranium ores, but also in cigarette smoke. This is a highly toxic compound, which may account for its recent and highly publicized suspected use to kill a Russian businessman. Although polonium is one of the so-called radon daughters, a term used to define a group of compounds produced by radon decay, and therefore can be suspected to exert immunosuppressive effects, no animal or human studies have seemingly been performed to investigate the immunotoxic potential of polonium.",7,2006-12-24 17:33:39
"f8","Germanium and derivatives","Germanium is a naturally occurring trace element that is devoid of any essential function in the living organisms. In its pure state, it is crystalline with the properties of a semiconductor. It is therefore widely used in the electronics industry, especially in optical equipment which requires extremely sensitive infrared detectors. Germanium derivatives include inorganic compounds, such as germanium tetrahydride, di- and tetrachloride, and dioxide; germanium telluride, bismuth germinate; and organometallic compounds, such as tetramethyl- or tetraethyl-germanium and isobutyl-germane. \r\n \r\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s, germanium oxide and 2-carboxyethyl-germanium sesquioxide became increasingly popular for use as dietary supplements claimed to prevent cancer and maintain good health [171] until associated toxic hazards had been adequately assessed.\r\n \r\nOverall, the impact of germanium and derivatives on the immune system is not known. Interestingly though, germanium as well as silicon, tin and lead share group 14 in the periodic table, and the chemical properties of organogermanium are close to those of organosilicons and organotins.\r\n ",7,2007-01-02 18:35:38
"f9","Histamine H2 receptor antagonists","In addition to its role in acute inflammatory and immediate hypersensitivity responses, histamine has been shown to influence functions of cells involved in the regulation of immune response and hematopoiesis including macrophages, dendritic cells, T and B lymphocytes, and endothelial cells. These cells express histamine receptors and secrete histamine. The pleiotropic effects of histamine are mediated by 4 types of G-protein coupled receptors, the histamine H1, H2, H3 and H4 receptors [179]. Via H2 receptors, histamine decreases eosinophil chemotaxis, and both neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. Triggering of histamine H2 receptors suppresses the antigen-presenting activity of dendritic cells, enhances IL-10 production and down-regulates CD14 expression on human monocytes. Both Th1 and Th2 responses are negatively regulated by histamine H2 receptors.\r\n \r\nSelective histamine H2 receptor antagonists that are primarily used as antiulcer therapy have also been extensively investigated for their potential as immune-modifying agents to treat a variety of pathological conditions including cancer, psoriasis and various chronic infections [180][181][182]. Most data suggest that cimetidine has some immunostimulatory effects. In contrast, results obtained with other selective antagonists were fairly inconsistent. This led some authors to conclude that the immunostimulatory effects of cimetidine may not be linked to its histamine H2 receptor antagonistic properties, but instead to the imidazole moiety of the molecule.\r\n \r\nHypersensitivity reactions to histamine H2 receptors antagonists are globally rather uncommon. Cross-reactivity has sometimes been described (see individual molecules).",8,2007-04-24 15:22:12
"f10","Anti-emetics","\r\nAnti-emetics are used to prevent or alleviate nausea and vomiting. A variety of substances pertaining to quite a few pharmacotherapeutic classes generally not restricted to anti-emetic properties have been used with varying efficacy. Only those medicines which are primarily used for their anti-emetic potency are considered in this section of IMMUNOTOXIBASE. Although the available information is very scarce, anti-emetics seem to have limited immunotoxic potential. The major therapeutic class consists of selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, which were introduced in the clinic relatively recently.",8,2007-04-26 11:26:22

By intercalating between base pairs of the DNA/RNA strands, anthracyclines inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis, and prevent the replication of cancer cells. Although the major specific toxicity of anthracyclines is cardiotoxicity presenting as ECG changes and arrhythmias, or as a cardiomyopathy, immunosuppression can be expected to ensue as a consequence of their mechanism of action on cell replication.",9,2007-10-30 14:57:37

"f31","Androgens and anabolic steroids","Androgens are natural or synthetic compounds that stimulate or control the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics by binding to specific receptors. Beside medical indications including androgen replacement therapy and the adjunctive treatment of various pathological conditions, such as aplastic anemia, hereditary angioedema and wasting diseases characterized by a loss of body cell mass, either acute wasting diseases, e.g. polytrauma, sepsis and major burns, or chronic wasting diseases, such as HIV infection, testosterone and its natural or synthetic analogs in the form of anabolic steroids are widely abused in sports because of their expected effects on muscle mass and performance.\r\nSince anabolic steroids increase protein synthesis, they might theoretically enhance the production of acute phase and immune proteins, but it has also been hypothesized that the immune system can play a substantial role in the origin of adverse effects of anabolic steroids [225]. In fact, little is known about the effects of anabolic steroids on immune function and immune disorders. Published findings are often conflicting. Markedly different effects have been observed depending on the dose regimen or tested compound [226][227]. To date, no adverse effects of these compounds have been clearly documented to be immune-mediated. Infectious complications including HIV infections, hepatitis B or C, abscesses of varied microbial origin have been reported in abusers of anabolic steroids, but the current evidence suggests these complications are very likely to be related to the mode of administration, i.e. intravenous route, or inappropriate conditions of use [228][229].",20,2007-05-03 14:01:38
"f32","Vitamin B1 (thiamine)","Vitamin B1, also called thiamine, is one of the 8 water-soluble B vitamins that collectively play a supportive role on cell growth and division, skin and muscle tone, and sustain immune and neurological functions. Vitamin B1 deficiencies are the only well-documented therapeutic indications including beri-beri, a rare disease caused by insufficient supply from the diet that primarily manifests with neurological and cardiac disorders, and the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a severe encephalopathy associated with peripheral neurological disorders due to thiamine deficiency related to severe and chronic alcoholism. It is noteworthy that neither condition includes clinical manifestations suggesting an impact on the immune system. \r\nVitamin B1 is often claimed to be useful to stimulate the immune system. In fact, this claim is not based on any objective data, either experimental or clinical. Several papers, mostly Russian papers published during the Soviet era seemingly found some immunostimulatory effects of vitamin B1 [242][243][244][245][246][247], but these data cannot be easily accessed. In any case, none of these findings have seemingly ever been reproduced and published elsewhere.\r\nThe only well-established adverse effects of thiamine on the immune system are hypersensitivity reactions that have been repeatedly reported since World War II. These reactions mostly consisted of anaphylactic shock and even sudden death.",19,2007-05-28 18:02:40

"f38","Hair dyes","Skin reactions have long been recognized as complications of hair dyes [321][322][323]. Allergic contact dermatitis is the most common hypersensitivity reaction associated with a variety of chemicals included in hair dye formulations (see individual chemicals for details). Accordingly, allergic contact dermatitis is frequently reported in occupationally exposed hairdressers and beauticians [324][325][326][327][328][329][330][331], but can also be seen in hair dye consumers and clients of beauty parlors [332][333][334][59][336]. Sensitization to hair dyes can also present as occupational asthma or rhinitis [337], or anaphylaxis. The causative role of hair dyes in the occurrence of various cancers has been a matter of extensive investigation and debate. An increased incidence of lymphoma and other lymphoid cancers has been suggested [338][339]. However, the vast majority of subsequent epidemiological studies failed to confirm a causal relationship. A case-control study of 2,153 AIDS subjects who had died of lymphoma, of whom 9 were beauticians or cosmetologists compared to 8,312 subjects with AIDS only, of whom 56 were beauticians or cosmetologists did not evidence a relationship between hair dye exposure and lymphoma [340]. Similarly, no increased incidence of hematopoietic cancers in relation to permanent hair dye use was found in a prospective cohort study of 99,067 women [341]. A literature review published in 2000 could not reach a firm conclusion [342]. Two further case-control studies did not find an appreciable association between hair dye use and the risk of lymphoid cancers [343] or lymphoma [344]. Finally, hair dyes happened to be also suspected as a causative factor of autoimmune diseases, but evidence for an increased incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus due to hair dyes was found neither in a case-control study of 218 lupus patients [345], nor a prospective cohort study of 106,391 women [346], nor a case-control study of 150 lupus patients [347], nor a case-control study of 91 lupus patients [348].",25,2007-07-18 12:12:31
